A lightweight, type-safe graphql hook for react, written in TypeScript.

#### Requirements

- React 16.8.0 or higher
- TypeScript 4.1 or higher

#### Why use this hook?

- Very lightweight (see the badges above for the latest size).
- Flexible and dead simple to use.
- Written in TypeScript
- Type-safe results (tested with [tsd](https://github.com/SamVerschueren/tsd))
- Autocompletion while writing query definitions
- Only has one required peer dependency: React 16.8.0 or higher.
- Liberal license: [zlib/libpng](https://github.com/Lusito/react-use-graphql-ts/blob/master/LICENSE)

This is no code-generator. It works purely by using TypeScript 4.1 features.

This is a **Work In Progress**! The API might change before version 1.0 is released.

### Installation via NPM

```npm i react-use-graphql-ts```
